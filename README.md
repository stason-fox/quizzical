# Quizzical

#### Description: Quiz trivia game. Tools used: React, CSS, HTML.

I designed a quiz trivia game that pulls data from a trivia API. I designed the quiz to have a main menu with a start button, the quiz questions, and the final page with the total score and a "play again" button. The quiz consists of 10 questions and each correct answer adds 1 to the total score, which is displayed on the final page. This project provided good practice using state and pulling data from an API.
